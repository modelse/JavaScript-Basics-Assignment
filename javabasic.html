             <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
             <br>
             <p>
                 JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremly
                 popular for a variety of reason. It is small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers
                 to take in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web brower or Node Server), it
                 can be connected to the object of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.
                 <ul>
                     <br>
                     <li>
                        <a href="https://www.google.com/">Variable Declaration</a>
                        JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values- imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds
                        the coffee, a variable holds a vlue. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique
                        names are called identifiers.<span> var x</span>;
                     </li>
                     <br>
                     <li>
                         <a href="https://www.google.com/">Variable Assignment</a>
                          Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables-our cup can now have coffee poured in it,
                          giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x=10</span>;
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.google.com/">Data Types</a>
                        Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are
                        six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean- <span>true</span> or <span>false</span>; null- <span>null</span>
                        aka nothing; Number- <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159</span>; string- <span>"Coding Dojo
                        Rocks!";</span> Array- <span>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object- <span>{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.google.com/">Conditionals</a>
                        When you write code, you want to perform different actions for differenct decisions- hitting different code
                        blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomploish this.
                        There are the following conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block;
                        <span> else if</span> to
                        specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else<span> execute this block of code;
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.google.com/">Loops</a>
                        There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will
                        repeat an action some numbers of times. Imaging you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.
                        Thats a loop!
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.google.com/">Function</a>
                        Functions are an encapsulation of code block. When we call our fucntion this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions.
                        As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to
                        the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call
                        our function over and over again.
                    </li>
